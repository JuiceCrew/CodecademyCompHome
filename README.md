Codecademy Company Home Page with Flexbox Project

This is my submission for Codecademy's Challenge Project: Company Home Page with Flexbox. I've been playing a lot of the game Warframe lately and drew inspiration from the in-game marketplace. I 
decided to try to recreate a simple version of it on a browser. 

The directions were to use flexbox to design and build the layout for a company's homepage. What content was up to the user to include but they asked to at least include:
    - A title and logo or splash image
    - A mission statement or brief description of the company
    - A list or set of images and titles representing the product or products of the company
    - A section describing some of the company's employees or teammates (I decided to include a Platinum section instead)
    - Use of custom styles such as colors, fonts, etc

Images used were from Google.
